# Quick Message Templates for paulroofs.com Team

## Template 1: Full Email (Detailed)

**Subject:** Integrating roofing web app into paulroofs.com â€” deployment plan & info needed

Hi [Team/Contact Name],

We're integrating a new web application into our paulroofs.com presence to manage customers, quotes, invoices, jobs, and leads. I need your help with hosting and DNS to get this deployed smoothly.

### What We're Integrating
- **App:** React/TypeScript SPA (Vite build) for roofing business operations
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres database + Google OAuth authentication)
- **Optional Features:** Email via Gmail API, document storage via Google Drive, calendar scheduling
- **Build Output:** Static files in `/dist` folder (standard SPA with client-side routing)

### Proposed Rollout Plan
- **Staging:** `app.paulroofs.com` (for testing and approval)
- **Production:** Either `paulroofs.com` (root domain) or keep `app.paulroofs.com` and link from main site
- **Zero-downtime:** SPA routing handled automatically (all routes rewrite to /index.html)

### Hosting Options (Need Your Input)

**Option A: Firebase Hosting** (Recommended)
- Pros: Automatic SSL, global CDN, zero ops overhead, generous free tier
- Deployment: `firebase deploy` after build
- DNS: CNAME/A records to Firebase IPs (provided by Firebase Console)

**Option B: Docker + Nginx on Your Server**
- Pros: Full control, can colocate with other services
- Deployment: Docker image via registry or SSH
- DNS: A-record to your server IP

### Information We Need From You

1. **DNS Provider & Access**
   - Who manages DNS? (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Route 53, Namecheap, etc.)
   - Can you add DNS records, or should we coordinate with your provider?

2. **Current paulroofs.com Stack**
   - What's the main site running on? (WordPress, static site, custom CMS, etc.)
   - Any CDN or reverse proxy in front? (Cloudflare, nginx, etc.)
   - Are there any CORS/security constraints we should know about?

3. **Hosting Preference**
   - Firebase Hosting (fast to deploy) or your server (Docker/Nginx)?
   - If server: OS, container runtime, reverse proxy setup

4. **Domain Placement Decision**
   - Staging at `app.paulroofs.com` (confirmed)
   - Production: use root domain `paulroofs.com` or keep app on subdomain `app.paulroofs.com`?

5. **If Using Custom Backend (Optional)**
   - Do you have an existing API for customers/quotes/invoices we should integrate with?
   - If yes: API base URL, authentication method, available endpoints

### DNS Changes We'll Request (After Hosting Confirmed)

**For Staging (app.paulroofs.com):**
- Firebase: `A` records to Firebase IPs + `TXT` for verification
- Server: `A` record to your server IP

**For Production (paulroofs.com):**
- Firebase: `A` records for apex domain, `A` or `CNAME` for www
- Server: `A` record for apex, `CNAME` for www

*Exact records will be provided once hosting is chosen.*

### Timeline
- **Staging deployment:** 1â€“2 business days after hosting/DNS confirmation
- **Production cutover:** 0â€“1 day after staging approval
- **Total:** ~2â€“3 business days from go-ahead to production

### Environment & Security
- **Build-time variables:** `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY` (public anon key, safe to expose)
- **OAuth redirects:** Will add final domain(s) to Supabase and Google Cloud Console
- **SPA routing:** All routes rewrite to `/index.html` (already configured in firebase.json and Dockerfile)
- **SSL/HTTPS:** Automatic with Firebase; you'll handle if self-hosting

### Next Steps
Please confirm:
1. Hosting preference: Firebase or your server?
2. DNS provider name and who will add records
3. Production domain preference: root (`paulroofs.com`) or subdomain (`app.paulroofs.com`)?
4. Any custom backend integration needed?

Once I have this information, I'll:
- Provide exact DNS records
- Deploy to staging environment
- Walk through final production cutover

## Template 2: Short Version (Email/Slack)

**Subject:** paulroofs.com app integration â€” hosting & DNS info needed

## After Sending, Expect These Questions:

**Q:** How much will Firebase cost?  
**A:** Generous free tier (10 GB storage, 360 MB/day transfer). Typical usage for small roofing company: $0â€“5/month.

**Q:** Can we keep our existing WordPress site?  
**A:** Yes. If production is at `paulroofs.com`, we can move WordPress to `www.paulroofs.com` or vice versa. Or keep app at `app.paulroofs.com` and link from main site.

**Q:** What if we want to change hosting later?  
**A:** Easy. Build output (`/dist`) is standard static files. Can move to Netlify, Vercel, S3, Cloudflare Pages, or any web server.

**Q:** Do we need to migrate data?  
**A:** Only if you have existing customer/quote/invoice data. Supabase has import tools, or we can write migration scripts.

**Q:** How do we update the app?  
**A:** Run `npm run build` + `firebase deploy` (or `docker build` + push to registry). Takes ~2 minutes.

**Q:** What about backups?  
**A:** Supabase has automatic daily backups (7 days free tier, 30+ days paid). Can also export DB on-demand.
