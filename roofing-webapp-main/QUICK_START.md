# Website Integration Quick Start

This is your fastest path from downloading this repo to having it live on paulroofs.com.

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Fill in these two required values in .env:
# REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 2. Test Local Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test the built app locally
```

### 3. Choose Deployment Method

**Option A: Firebase (Recommended)**
```bash
# Windows
scripts\deploy-firebase.bat staging

# Mac/Linux
./scripts/deploy-firebase.sh staging
```

**Option B: Docker**
```bash
# Windows/Mac/Linux
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh deploy
```

## 🎯 Integration Paths

### Path 1: New Supabase Project (Recommended)
**Time: 15 minutes**

1. Create Supabase project → [Guide](docs/supabase-setup.md)
2. Run database schema → Copy `database/schema.sql` to Supabase SQL Editor
3. Configure Google OAuth → [Step-by-step guide](docs/supabase-setup.md#step-4-configure-authentication)
4. Deploy to staging → Run deployment script
5. Test & approve → Deploy to production

### Path 2: Connect Your Existing Backend
**Time: 30-60 minutes**

If you already have a customer/invoice API:

1. **Map your endpoints** to our data structure:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Update src/services/api/customer-service.ts
   const API_BASE = 'https://your-api.com/v1';
   
   export const getCustomers = async () => {
     const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/customers`);
     return response.json();
   };
   ```

2. **Update authentication** in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
3. **Test integration** locally
4. **Deploy** using either method above

### Path 3: Hybrid Approach
**Time: 20 minutes**

Keep Supabase for the app, integrate specific features with your systems:

1. **Use Supabase** for main app data (fast setup)
2. **Add webhook/API calls** to sync with your existing systems
3. **Connect email** to your SMTP instead of Gmail API
4. **Customize branding** and domain

## 🚀 Deployment Commands
